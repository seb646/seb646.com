				      <p class="description">GoRound was a mobile application designed to give users restaurant recommendations based on a unique A.I. algorithm. The app was location based and did not reply on potentially sponsored or biased external ratings. Unfortunately, the GoFundMe did not generate enough money to fund a minimum-viable product, so the idea was scrapped after over a year of marketing campaigns, fundraising, and development. I managed a small team of employees focused on designing the application's interface and ensuring a good user experience. We did everything from designing the startup's website and creating app UI mockups to creating advertisements for display at the Denver International Airport.</p>
